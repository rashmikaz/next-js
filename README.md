<h1>What is Next.js?</h1>
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.It adds features and tools on top of React that make development easier, faster, and more powerful.

## 🔑 Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
  Pages can be rendered on the server before being sent to the browser, making apps faster and SEO-friendly.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
  Pre-generate pages at build time for great performance (like a static site) while still enjoying React’s interactivity.

- **API Routes**  
  Create backend endpoints directly inside your project without needing a separate server.

- **File-Based Routing**  
  No manual route setup needed — the folder/file structure in `pages/` (or `app/` with the new App Router) automatically generates routes.

- **Optimized Performance**  
  Features like `next/image` (image optimization), automatic code splitting, and fast refresh ensure efficient apps.

- **Full-Stack Capabilities**  
  Build both frontend and backend within the same project.

- **TypeScript Support**  
  Comes with seamless TypeScript integration out of the box.
