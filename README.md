<h1>What is Next.js?</h1>
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.It adds features and tools on top of React that make development easier, faster, and more powerful.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of Next.js

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Pages can be rendered on the server before being sent to the browser, making apps faster and SEO-friendly.

Static Site Generation (SSG)
You can pre-generate pages at build time for performance (like a static site) but still use Reactâ€™s interactivity.

API Routes
You donâ€™t always need a separate backend â€” Next.js lets you create backend endpoints inside the project.

File-Based Routing
Instead of configuring routes manually, the folder/file structure inside pages/ (or app/ in the new App Router) automatically creates routes.

Optimized Performance
Built-in features like image optimization (next/image), automatic code splitting, and fast refresh make apps efficient.

Full-Stack Capabilities
You can build both frontend and backend in the same project.

TypeScript Support
Works seamlessly with TypeScript out of the box.
